  <h2>The Office</h2>
  <h4>Philosophy</h4>
  <p>The Office excels with new ideas, going from concept and ideation to production and delivery. Our goal, every time, is to deliver the absolute best outcome within a Client's budget and timeline. The process is kept minimal and agile enough to adjust accordingly to ensure all requirements are met with the highest quality possible within these known constraints.</p>
  <p>Design is incredibly important for a product or service to succeed. Its importance is only trending upward, as more people become used to quality experiences and less patient with the opposite. Therefore, we want to always be there for you for emergent requests as well as general design and tech support.</p>
  <p>We really (really) like to design for good. Significant discounts and credits are provided for Clients delivering social or environmental benefits.</p>
  <h4>Process</h4>
  <p>Design Thinking is a powerful and crucial part of the process. It can benefit any mission and help find effective solutions to just about any problem. As such, it is our first stop along the project journey, and constantly revisited throughout all projects. Call it our base camp. From here, we can scale any mountain (or hill).</p>
  <p>The Office utilizes Participatory Design where the Client is viewed more as a collaborator and involved in critical stages of the ideation process. This keeps us all on the most direct path to shared success.</p>
  <p>Iteration along the way is essential to refining our work into the most elegant and tested of outcomes.</p>
  <p>User Centered Design is also key. We empathize directly, and consistently, with the needs and desires of the end-user of a product or service, be it a website user or a retail customer, to validate our deliverables.</p>
  <p>In general, the process is built to rapidly deliver the highest quality outcome with minimal resources.</p>
  <h4>Sustainability</h4>
  <p>As Designers, we are responsible for the materials and practices we suggest to our Clients. As such, the Office proudly adheres to the sustainable methodology outlined by <a href="http://designersaccord.org" target="_blank">The Designers Accord</a>.</p>

  <h4><span style="font-size: small;">Founder</span><br>Ven Gist</h4>
  <div class="avatar" [ngStyle]="{'background-image': 'url(../assets/images/bio-ven.jpg)'}"></div>
  <p>Ven Gist is a Designer by trade, as well as by nature. He started in Graphic Design, drinking a ton of coffee and hand drawing typography all day. As the bulk of our interactions moved more towards digital, he learned code to facilitate more effective collaboration with developers and produce better project outcomes. Today, he creates within a broad spectrum of Design & Technology.</p>
  <p>Beyond the Office, he is Cofounder and CEO of the private land sharing startup <a href="https://www.landapart.com" target="_blank">LandApart</a>, Founding Principal of the Design and Tech collective <a href="http://aestheticsdept.co" target="_blank">Aesthetics Dept</a>, and volunteers Product Design and Facilitation at <a href="http://hackoregon.org" target="_blank">Hack Oregon</a>.</p>
  <p>When out of office, he can most often be found rambling in the woods with his adventure pup, Mesrine.</p>
  <h4 class="break">Collaborators</h4>
  <p>As a project requires, the Office calls on its collaborators to enhance or accelerate a project outcome. Collectively, we can satisfy just about any design requirement.</p>
